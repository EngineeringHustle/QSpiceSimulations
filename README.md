# QSpice Simulations #

QSpice is a great simulation tool for power electronics, especially for digitally controlled SMPS.

In this repository I make my simple simulations available for everyone to use.  
Videos about it are posted in my youtube channel [Engineering Hustle](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCafs91zRzdI98hbcaVF7J0g)

QSpice can be donwloaded from [Qorvo](https://www.qorvo.com/design-hub/design-tools/interactive/qspice/)

The repository consists of the follwowing simulations:  
  - "ADC" folder: [Modeling an ADC in QSpice using C++](https://youtu.be/-aYlnroWEcY)  
  - "PWM" folder: [Simulating an MCU PWM in QSpice using C++](https://youtu.be/mbZipu5a9d0)  
  - "advancedPWM" folder: [Simulating an STM32 PWM in C++ using QSpice](https://youtu.be/wKMv13TqsCo)  
  - "GateDriver" folder: [Designing and Simulating a discrete Gate Driver in QSpice](https://youtu.be/oiditMghUdc)
