QSpice is a great simulation tool for power electronics, especially for digitally controlled SMPS.

In this repository I make my simple simulations available for everyone to use.
Videos about it are posted in my youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCafs91zRzdI98hbcaVF7J0g

QSpice can be donwloaded from Qorvo https://www.qorvo.com/design-hub/design-tools/interactive/qspice/

The repository consists of the follwowing simulations:
	- "ADC" folder: Modeling an ADC in QSpice using C++, shown in https://youtu.be/-aYlnroWEcY
	- "PWM" folder: Simulating an MCU PWM in QSpice using C++, shown in https://youtu.be/mbZipu5a9d0
	- "advancedPWM" folder: Simulating an STM32 PWM in C++ using QSpice, shown in https://youtu.be/wKMv13TqsCo
	- "GateDriver" folder: Designing and Simulating a discrete Gate Driver in QSpice, shown in https://youtu.be/oiditMghUdc
