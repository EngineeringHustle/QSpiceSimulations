QSpice is a great simulation tool for power electronics, especially for digitally controlled SMPS.

In this repository I make my simple simulations available for everyone to use.
Videos about it are posted in my youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCafs91zRzdI98hbcaVF7J0g

QSpice can be donwloaded from Qorvo https://www.qorvo.com/design-hub/design-tools/interactive/qspice/
